# Salesforce Developer Tools

There are multiple code editors that Salesforce supports that help you write code, that is Lightning Components or back-end code like Apex.

Apart from these code editors, Salesforce also has some tools available on the Salesforce platform itself where you can write your Apex code.

Let's talk about all these tools in this section



## Salesforce Setup

The first one is the Salesforce Setup.

Go to the Salesforce setup and search for Apex Trigger or Apex Class, and you can click on any of the Apex Class that you have written before, or you can create a new Apex Class.

In this location itself, Salesforce gives you a code editor where you can write your Apex code. Using Salesforce setup, you can write Apex Class, Apex Trigger or Visual Force pages, but it does not support Lightning Components.

If you want to write an aura component, you can not use Salesforce setup to write the code.

It is not recommended to use Setup to write code as there are better tools available


## Developer Console

Apart from Salesforce setup, Salesforce also provides another tool which is called Developer Console. Go to your setup gear icon and from there, you will see an option called Developer Console as shown below

On loading the developer console in a new window you get the following menu.

Once you click on this option, it's going to open a new window or a new browser tab where you can
write your code. The Developer Console supports Apex Classes, Apex Triggers, Visual Force Pages and Aura
Components or Lightning web components.

It has many features like, you can view your logs from the developer Console.

You can also run test classes from developer Console, or you can also write anonymous code or
to test your functionality.


## VS Code

Let us move on and talk about one of the best code editor available for Salesforce, and that is **VS Code**.

Salesforce recommends that you use VS Code to write your Apex code or to write your Lightning Components, and it's much easier to setup, and it supports all kind of development work in Salesforce.

You can write your Apex Classes, your Visual Force pages, Apex Triggers, Aura Components or Lightning Web Components.

And it's much easier to deploy your changes back to your Salesforce Org using VS Code, and the best part about VS Code is, it's an open source tool,


Salesforce has its own extension pack for VS Code that can help you write your code much faster.

We will be using combination Salesforce Setup, the Developer Console and the VS Code editor for our development purpose or to write our Apex code, and you'll also get a feel of how you can use these different tools to do your development work.
