## Creating your own domain

Under setup menu, search for my domain and click on this my domain setting. Now, enabling my domain is also essential if you want to build the lightning components on Salesforce platform.

In the input box try for the different domain name that you may want to use for your Developer Edition Org, then click on check availability.

If your domain name is available, then Salesforce will tell you about it, and then, this register domain button will be enabled.


Salesforce takes some time to enable **my domain** in the Developer Edition Org.

It can take anywhere between five to ten minutes, Salesforce sends an e-mail to you when the my domain is ready to use or else you can also keep on refreshing this browser tab.

When my domain name is ready let us click on Login button

The login is successful.

Now, I can deploy this my domain to all my Developer Edition Org's users.

So, click on 'deploy to all the users', and that's it.

You have enabled my domain in your Developer Edition Org.
Notice the URL change for your Developer Edition Org,
you no longer see that ap17 here.

What you see is your **My domain name**, which was sfa-dev-training, and then Salesforce also adds keywords like dev-ed, because this is a Developer Edition Org.

So from now on, if you want to login inside your Developer Edition Org, along with the login.salesforce.com, you can also directly go to your My domain name.

### Changes in Developer Edition

Now, let's also change few more things in our Developer Edition Org.

And, this is only recommended for this Developer Edition Org, never do these steps in your Production Orgs or in  sandboxes.



The first one is about password policies. We don't want my password to expire, so I click on never expires here and click on save.

Let us also go to session setting, and here you can change the time out value From 2 hours to 24 hours.

So, even if you leave the  Salesforce Org without doing any work for upto 24 hours, you will not get locked out.

And these are helpful settings in the Developer Environment, but you don't want to do these in your Sandboxes and in your Productions. So, make sure you don't play around with these settings in your productions.
